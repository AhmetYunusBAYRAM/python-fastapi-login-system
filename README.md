**Project Name: Python FastAPI Login System**

**Description:**

The "Python FastAPI Login System" project is built using the FastAPI framework, incorporating a login system and utilizing the concepts of "tenantID" and "accessToken" for system operation. The project is designed on the FastAPI framework, which is tailored for the development of modern and high-performance web applications.

**Key Features of the Project:**

1. **Usage of FastAPI:**
   The project is constructed on the FastAPI framework, a Python web framework known for its speed, user-friendliness, and security. It provides developers with the capability to build high-performance and scalable web applications.

2. **Login System:**
   The project includes a login system allowing users to securely authenticate and access the application.

3. **Utilization of TenantID:**
   "TenantID" is employed to isolate user data in multi-tenancy systems. With a unique identifier for each user, known as "tenantID," access to user-specific data is facilitated.

4. **AccessToken Logic:**
   For enhanced security, the project employs the use of an "accessToken" after user authentication to facilitate authorization. This token represents the user's permission to access specific resources.

**Advantages of the Project:**

- **Security:**
  The project employs modern authentication methods for users to securely log into the system. The use of AccessToken adds an extra layer of security for authorization.

- **Multi-Tenancy Support:**
  The use of "tenantID" makes it easier to isolate and manage user data in multi-tenancy systems.

- **Performance and Scalability:**
  Leveraging FastAPI's speed and scalability, the application enhances performance and can handle high demand.

- **Modular Structure:**
  The project adopts a modular structure, providing developers with the flexibility to make customizations according to their needs.

**Usage:**

1. Download the project files to your computer.
2. In the terminal or command prompt, enter the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Start the application by running the command `uvicorn main:app --reload` in the project directory.
4. Access the application by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your web browser.

This project is designed to offer secure user authentication, support for multi-tenancy systems, and secure access, all while adhering to modern web development standards. The speed and security features of FastAPI combined with this project provide developers with a robust foundation for building powerful web applications.
